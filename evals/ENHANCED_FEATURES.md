🤖 AI Analysis & Insights

📊 Analysis Summary
Success Rate: 86.7%    Avg Accuracy: 0.73    Avg Latency: 2.1s    Total Cases: 1,200

💡 Key Insights
🎉 Excellent performance! 86.7% success rate
📝 Vague prompts perform poorly: 45.2% vs 78.3% for detailed prompts
🎯 Complex workflows achieve higher accuracy: 0.82 vs 0.65
⚡ Fast responses are more successful: 89.1% vs 67.3% for slow responses
📊 Higher latency correlates with better accuracy (r=0.42) - system thinking more carefully

🎯 Improvement Recommendations
1. Add prompt templates and examples to guide users toward more specific requests
2. Focus on improving multi-step workflow generation
3. Implement aggressive caching for common patterns
4. Add workflow complexity scoring to help users understand requirements

🔍 Deep Pattern Analysis
📝 Prompt Patterns:
  • Vague prompts perform poorly: 45.2% vs 78.3% for detailed prompts
  • Specific prompts work much better: 89.1% vs 67.3% for vague requests

🔗 Workflow Complexity:
  • Complex workflows perform better: 82.1% vs 71.3% for simple workflows
  • Complex workflows achieve higher accuracy: 0.82 vs 0.65

⚡ Performance Patterns:
  • Fast responses are more successful: 89.1% vs 67.3% for slow responses
  • Higher latency correlates with better accuracy (r=0.42)

🚨 Failure Patterns:
  • 12/45 failures are from very short prompts - users need more guidance
  • 18/45 failures contain generic automation keywords - prompts need more specificity
